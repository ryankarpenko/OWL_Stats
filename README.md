# owlstats
Python functions for easy and flexible access to Overwatch League statistics via the OWL API.

Inspired by /Metlover's OWL R library: https://github.com/Metlover/owlstats

NOTE: As of the 2020 season, the OWL API is no longer supported or updated by Blizzard. However, the statistics for the 2018 and 2019 seasons are still available through the API, and therefore through these functions.
